This project (Reciplia) has been entirely coded in React, utilizes Firebase authentication social logins, as well as the NoSQL database-Firebase.  It makes use of an API for recipes. It has been deployed via Heroku.  A YouTube video will be made as a means of presenting this app.

This app, once completed, will feature:
* social login options of Google, Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, and email
* a way for users to obtain recipes, simply by searching by food or ingredient(s).
* users will be able to favorite or unfavorite recipes (favorited will be added to the database for future reference, and deleted ones will be deleted from the database).
